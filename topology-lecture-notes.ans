Take some sets \(\set{C_a}_{a \in \mathcal{A}}\), so that each \(C_a \subseteq X\) is closed.
The complement \(U_a\defeq X-C_a\) is open.
So the union \(U \defeq \bigcup_a U_a\) is open.
So its complement \(C=X-U\) is closed.
But \(C\) is the set of points of \(X\) not belonging to \(U\), i.e. not belonging to any \(U_a\), i.e. belonging to \(C_a\) instead of \(U_a\) for every \(a\), i.e. \(C=\bigcap_a C_a\).

The diagonal is closed just when its complement is open.
Its complement is the set \(U \subset X \times X\) of pairs of distinct points.
This \(U\) is open just when every point of \(U\) lies inside a basis element which lies in \(U\), for any basis, and in particular for the basis consisting of products \(U_1 \times U_2\) of open sets \(U_1, U_2 \subset X\).
So the diagonal is closed just when, for any pair of distinct points \(x_1 \ne x_2\) in \(X\), the point \((x_1,x_2)\) lies inside a subset \(U_1 \times U_2 \subset X \times X\) which does not intersect the diagonal.
In other words, just when \(x_1 \in U_1\) and \(x_2 \in U_2\) but \(U_1 \cap U_2\) is empty.

Take compact sets \(K_a\) and let \(K\) be their intersection.
Take an open cover \(U_b\) of \(K\).

Therefore the intersection \(K\) is closed, so \(X-K\) is open.
The open sets \(\set{X-K} \cup \set{U_b}\) cover \(X\).
So each set \(K_a\) is covered by these, and so covered by finitely many of these.
But then those finitely many cover \(K \subset K_a\).
So \(K\) is compact.
Suppose that \(K\) is empty.
The open sets \(W_b \defeq X-K_b\) cover \(X\).
Each set \(K_a\) is compact, so finitely many \(W_b\) cover \(K_a\), say \(W_{b_1}, \dots, W_{b_n}\).

Take a point \(x_0\in X\).
So \(x_0\) lies in one of our \(X_a\) open sets lying in a compact set, and hence (by Hausdorffness!) with compact closure \(\bar{X}_a\).
Every open set \(U\) around \(x_0\) contains \(U\cap X_a\), which has compact closure, hence a basis of precompact open sets.

If \(X',X''\) are two such spaces, define \(f\colon X'\to X''\) to be the identity on \(X\) and \(\infty\to\infty\).
Take an open set \(U\subseteq X'\).
If \(\infty\) is not in \(U\), \(f(U)=U\) is open since \(X\subset X''\) is embedded.
If \(\infty\in U\), \(C\defeq X'-U=X-(U-\infty)\) is closed in \(X'\) so compact in \(X'\), therefore in \(X\) since \(X\subset X'\) is embedded, and so \(C\) is compact in \(X''\), and so closed since \(X''\) is Hausdorff.
Hence \(U=X''-C\) is open.
Therefore \(f\) is an open map, and so is \(f^{-1}\) by the same argument, so both are homeomorphisms.

Following problem~\vref{problem:continuity:1.point}, let \(X'\) be the one point compactification of \(X\).
We need to prove that \(X'\) is compact and Hausdorff and that \(X\subset X'\) is embedded.
Trivially any open set \(U\subset X'\) intersects \(X\) in an open set, so the inclusion map \(X\to X'\) is continuous.
Conversely, any open set in \(X\) is open in \(X'\), so the inclusion map is open, hence an embedding.

Take an open cover of \(X'\) by open sets \(X'_a\).
Each is either \(X'_a=(X-C_a)\cup\set{\infty}\) for a compact set \(C_a\subseteq X\) or \(X'_a=X_a\) for open sets \(X_a\subseteq X\).
At least one of these \(X'_a\) contains \(\infty\), so is some \(X-C_{a_0}\).
The sets \(X_a\) or \(X-C_a\) cover \(X'-\set{\infty}\) so cover \(X\).
Because \(C_{a_0}\subseteq X\) is compact, \(C_{a_0}\) is covered by finitely many of these.
So then \(X'=X\cup\set{\infty}\) is covered by those finitely many together with \((X-C_{a_0})\cup\set{\infty}\).

To see that \(X'\) is Hausdorff, note that \(X\subset X'\) is embedded and Hausdorff.
Take two points \(x,y\in X'\).
If both are in \(X\), then they are housed off.
So we can suppose that \(y=\infty\) and \(x\\in X\).
Because \(X\) is locally compact, we can choose a compact set \(C\subseteq X\) containing an open set \(U\) around \(x\), and then \(U,(X-C)\cup\set{\infty}\) house \(x,\infty\).

If \(X'\) satisfying these three conditions exists, we need to prove that \(X\) is locally compact and Hausdorff.
But \(X\subset X'\) is embedded in a Hausdorff space, so Hausdorff.
Pick a point \(x\in X\) and houses in \(X'\): open sets \(U,V\subseteq X'\) so that \(x\in U\) and \(\infty\in V\) and \(U\cap V\) is empty.
Then \(C=X'-V\) is closed in \(Y\) so compact, and so compact in \(X\), and contains \(U\).
So \(X\) is locally compact.

The image \(f(A)\) of a closed set \(A\subseteq X\) is closed in \(Y\) so closed \(f(X)\).
Hence we can replace \(Y\) by \(f(X)\) and assume the map is a bijection.
Closed sets have closed images.
Open sets have open images by taking complements.
But then for \(f^{-1}\colon Y\to X\), the \(f^{-1}\)-preimages of open sets are just exactly the \(f\)-images, so open.
So \(f^{-1}\) is continuous.

Choose finitely many open sets \(U_{\alpha_i}\subseteq X\) covering \(f^{-1}\set{y_0}\); let \(U\) be their union.
Check that \(y_0\) belongs to
\[
W\defeq Y-f(X-U)

which is open since \(f\) is closed.
Note that \(f^{-1}W\subset U\).
For each \(y_0\in Y\), there is some such open set \(W\).
Cover \(K\) by finitely many such \(W\), say \(W_j\), each arising as
\[
W_j=Y-f(X-U_j),
\]
from some open set \(U_j\subset X\) which itself is a finite union of open sets \(U_{\alpha_i}\) on \(X\).
So \(f^{-1}K\) lies inside the union of the various \(f^{-1}W_j\), each of which lies in its \(U_j\).
So \(f^{-1}K\) lies in a finite union of \(U_{\alpha_i}\) sets.

The firs problem is to use linear algebra to prove that any matrix \(A\in Y\) arises as a \emph{Gram matrix}
\[
A=\varphi(v_1,\dots,v_n),

where \(\varphi\) is the map giving \(A_{ij}=\ip{v_i}{v_j}\).
For this, you can use induction on dimension.
The second problem is to show that this Gram matrix uniquely determines the vectors \(v_1,\dots,v_n\) up to orthogonal linear transformation.
Hence the map \(\varphi\) associating to vectors their Gram matrix is an injection modulo the action of the orthogonal group.
The third problem is to prove that every point \(A\in Y\) lies in the interior of the image of a compact set of choices of vectors \(v_1,\dots,v_n\); but this follows from taking all of the vectors to lie in some large enough ball in \(\R{n}\), so that every Gram matrix whose diagonals are bounded by the radius of that ball lies in the image of that set.

  If we let \(t=\pi |x|\) then \(|f(x)|^2=\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t=1\), so \(f\) is valued in the unit sphere \(Y\).
  Continuity is clear except when \(|x| \to 0\), but then the fact that \(\sin' t=\cos t\) tells us that
  \[
  \frac{\sin t}{t}
  \]
  is continuous with
  \[
  1 = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\sin t}{t}
  \]
  by L'Hôpital's rule.
  Write
\[
f(x)=
\begin{cases}
\left(\cos(\pi |x|), \frac{\sin(\pi |x|)}{|x|}x\right), & \text{ if \(|x|\ne 0\)}, \\
(1,0), & \text{ if \(|x|=0\).}
\end{cases}
\]
to see that \(f(x) \to (1,0)\) as \(|x| \to 0\), continuity.
  Clearly \(f(0)=(1,0)\) and, if \(|x|=1\), then \(f(x)=(-1,0)\).
  Since \(0 \le \pi|x| \le 1\),  if \(f(x)=(-1,0)\) then \(\cos(\pi|x|)=-1\) and \(\sin(\pi|x|)=0\) and so \(\pi|x|=\pi\), i.e. \(|x|=1\).
  If \(x, y \in X\) and \(|x|<1\) and \(|y|<1\) and if \(f(x)=f(y)\) then
  \[
  \cos(\pi|x|)=\cos(\pi|y|)
  \]
  so \(0\le |x|=|y| < 1\).
  But then also
  \[
  \sin(\pi|x|)x=\sin(\pi|y|)y
  \]
  and \(\sin(\pi|x|) \ne 0\) so \(x=y\).
  Hence \(f\) is continuous and 1-1.
  Since \(X\) is compact and \(Y\) is Hausdorff and \(f\) is onto, \(f\) identifies \(Y\) with the quotient of \(X\) by the map, i.e. with the closed ball with its boundary glued to a single point.

Then \(f\) is a homeomorphism of \(U_{x_1}\) to its image inside \(U_{y_1}\); call its image \(V_{y_1}\).
Similarly define \(V_{y_2}\).
Because \(f\) homeomorphically maps \(U_{x_1}\) to \(V_{y_1}\), \(V_{y_1}\) is an open set in \(Y\).

The set \(P_{q_0}\) intersects \(U_{p_0}\) in a set taken by \(f\) to \(\Set{q_0}\), so just the single point \(p_0\).
Therefore every point \(p_0 \in P_{q_0}\) lies an open set \(U_{p_0}\) containing only \(p_0\), so \(P_{q_0}\) is a discrete set of points.
Being compact, \(P_{q_0}\) is therefore a finite set of points, say

Then replace \(U_{p_j}\) by

Each element of the group is uniquely determined by how it maps any one point, since they act without fixed points.
Define elements \(\gamma_i\) by \(\gamma_i(t_0)=t_i\).

Each element of the fundamental group is a homeomorphism of \(\R{}\), so an increasing or decreasing proper map \(\R{}\to\R{}\).
If decreasing, it has a fixed point by the intermediate value theorem, so it is an increasing function, so preserves the ordering of the \(t_i\).
Hence \(t_j\) takes \(t_0\mapsto t_0+t_j=t_j\), and so sends \(t_1\) to \(t_{j+1}\), and so on.
Hence the fundamental group is isomorphic to \(\Z{}\).
Each interval \([t_i,t_{i+1}]\) is mapped to the quotient space injectivity except at the ends, so quotients to \(S^1\), an bijective continuous map from a compact Hausdorff space, so a homeomorphism by theorem~\vref{theorem:continuous.bijection}.

Pick a point \(x_0\in X\) and a point \(\tilde{x}_0\in\tilde{X}\) above it.
Quotienting \(\psi\) by deck transformations gives a map \(X\xrightarrow{\varphi}X\), a local homeomorphism because it is locally identified with \(\psi\).
The map \(\varphi\) is injective, because \(\psi(x)=\gamma\psi(y)\) implies \(y=\alpha x\) if \(\alpha'=\gamma\).
The map \(\varphi\) is onto because \(\psi\) is.
Clearly \(\psi\) lifts \(\varphi\).
