\chapter*{Preface}
There are many excellent books of topology; from the bibliography at the end of this book, the reader might look at \cite{MR705632,MR1700700,MR1867354,MR2483686,MR734483,MR2218695,Milnor:1997,MR3728284,MR2313004,MR2233951,MR2155623,MR1679607,MR1384994,MR2456045}.
So it might have been wise to avoid writing these notes. 
They explain what I tried to cover in my 2017 lectures on topology for undergraduate students at University College Cork.
I assume the reader is familiar with elementary theory of metric spaces.
I will also give a few examples from differential geometry, which the reader can ignore, and which assume familiarity with manifolds and diffeomorphisms.
